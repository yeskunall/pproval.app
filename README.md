[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/yeskunall/pproval.app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/yeskunall/pproval.app)

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pproval-org/app.git
```

### Prerequisites

The instructions that follow assume that you at least have Java version 11 installed. Development is done on [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), so it is expected that you have it installed. The following steps also assume that you have the project opened (not imported) in IntelliJ, and that you have all Maven projects imported already

### Notes

* The project uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to avoid writing duplicate boilerplate code. For an example, see [here](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter)

* This project uses `spring-boot-devtools` for hot swapping and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) for hot reloading. With the LiveReload script injected into the app, in IntelliJ, do <kbd>⌘ F9</kbd> to build the app and trigger a live reload in the browser

* This repository (_not_ the project) has a moot dependency on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). The __pproval.app__ team uses Node along with `husky`, `lint-staged`, and `google-code-format` for in-house maintenance. See the [Code Style](#code-style) section for more

## Running the app

If you imported the project correctly, you should see a configuration called “run”—run it. It essentially starts the Spring Boot server

### Code Style

This project follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). A `git` hook is setup using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) that runs [`google-java-format`](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) against all `*.java` files automagically

## Deployment

The app is deployed to Heroku: the `master` branch is automatically deployed to Heroku once the CI tests pass
